    <h3>Do I have to pay for my appointment with a Dr?</h3>

    An appointment for a workers’ compensation injury does not need payment on the day. An account will be sent to your employer. Should liability not be accepted, the worker may be required to pay outstanding accounts.<br><br>

    <h3>What forms do I need to give to my Employer?</h3>

    Following your appointment you will be provided with a WA WorkCover First Certificate of Capacity. This medical certificate and a Form 2B (this can be obtained from your Employer or REDIMED) must be given to your Employer following your appointment. These documents are required to submit a workers’ compensation claim.<br>

    <h3>Does my Employer need to attend my appointment?</h3>

    At REDIMED we recommend open communication between all parties and encourage attendance of the employer at medical appointments. This allows for open discussion regarding return to work and available duties.<br>

    <h3>What is my claim number?</h3>

    Your claim number is provided to you from your employers’ insurance company. This number must be provided to your treating providers to ensure all certificates and invoices are sent to the insurer for payment.<br>
